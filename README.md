# STUDENT-GRIEVANCE-SYSTEM
A simplified web based student grievance system


•In colleges if anyone wants to raise complaint then one has to write on a paper and wait for the respond to whom it’s addressed. • Student has to signup/login and raise complain about the issues he finds.

• Admin has to login through his login id and can view the complaints that has been raised by the students.

• Based on the categories Admin can filter the complaints as Department level, Institute Level or University level . Further, Admin can subcategorise the complaints as for Admission, Finance, Exams, Lecture, Timetable, Paper Re evaluation, Others.

• Later, Admin can sort complaints based on some priorities or keywords.

• In this system, the admin can view the complaint details and takes further actions required accordingly. Each complaint will have a definite time limit associated with it.

• After expiry of time the complaint gets promoted to Institute level and if moreover, the Institute takes no action then the same complaint gets promoted to University level wherein a mail is forwarded to University through a predefined mail. This makes it easier for the University to recognise that the complaint is came from the Grievance System.

• The student gets the notification whether the complaint is IN PROCESS or it has been CLOSED by the Admin ON Dashboard.

• Student needs to check the complaint status whereas Admin needs to check the complaint regularly to see whether new complaint has been filed or not.
